# INTRODUCTION

The main goal now is to examine and understand the variations in usage
styles between annual members and casual cyclists. The study intends to
shed light on how these two user groups use the bike-sharing services
offered by Cyclistic in various ways. The final objective is to use
these insights to create a focused marketing plan that aims to turn
occasional riders into yearly subscribers. The analysis will be
supported by data from previous bike trips, and the conclusions will be
vital in guiding Cyclistic's data-driven decision-making.

This commercial endeavor supports Cyclistic's strategic goal of
increasing the number of annual subscriptions because it has been
determined that these members are more profitable than casual riders.
The analysis will serve as the basis for suggestions to improve the
business's marketing initiatives and promote annual membership growth.

The insights drawn from the study will directly influence Cyclistic's
marketing plan. These data will specifically lead the formulation of a
marketing plan meant to turn casual riders into yearly subscribers. Here
is how business decisions will be affected the outcomes:

Segmented marketing: Cyclistic executive team may improve its marketing
efforts by comprehending the variations in usage patterns between annual
members and casual riders. For instance, incentives and promotions can
be created to specifically target casual riders based on their
requirements and preferences.

Pricing and Membership Plans: Cyclistic executive team can improve its
pricing strategies and membership plans by learning more about the
reasons casual cyclists might think about purchasing annual
subscriptions. This can entail developing more enticing membership plans
that align with the interests of casual riders.

**Brief background and summary of case study company**

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. It has a fleet of over
5,800 bicycles and 692 stations across the city. Cyclistic's customers
can purchase single-ride passes, full-day passes, or annual memberships.
Single-ride passes and full-day passes are popular with casual riders,
while annual memberships are popular with people who use Cyclistic bikes
on a regular basis.

Cyclistic's director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that the
company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual
members. Therefore, she has assigned her team to analyze the data to
identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently. This information will be used to design a new marketing
strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

# ASK PHASE

The problem we are trying to solve in the Cyclistic scenario is
understanding how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently. This understanding is crucial to designing a marketing
strategy to convert casual riders into annual members effectively. Our
insights will drive business decisions by providing data-driven
recommendations for designing a marketing strategy. By understanding the
differences in bike usage between these two customer groups, Cyclistic
can tailor its marketing efforts to target casual riders more
effectively and encourage them to become annual members.

## Business Task

The business task is to analyze and compare the bike usage patterns of
annual members and casual riders. This analysis will provid e insights
into how these customer segments differ in their usage of Cyclistic
bikes.

By comparing their usage patterns, we aim to identify key differences
and insights that can inform the design of a new marketing strategy to
convert casual riders into annual members.

## **Consider key stakeholders**

**Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing)** Responsible for overseeing all
marketing initiatives at Cyclistic, including the development of
campaigns and strategies to promote the bike-share program.

**Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team** A group of data analysts
responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that informs
Cyclistic's marketing strategy. They work collaboratively to leverage
data-driven insights in shaping marketing efforts.

**Cyclistic Executive Team** A group of high-level decision-makers
within the company who have the authority to approve or reject the
recommended marketing program. They are known for being detail-oriented
and have a significant impact on the overall direction of the company.

**Annual Members** A user's who have purchased annual memberships,
providing them with long-term access to the bike-sharing service. They
are committed users who contribute significantly to Cyclistic's revenue.

**Casual Riders** An individual who uses Cyclistic's bike-sharing
services on a non-membership basis, such as purchasing single-ride
passes or full-day passes. They are not committed annual members but
represent a significant portion of Cyclistic's user base.

## Deliverable

A clear statement of the business task has been defined, which is to
understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently. This statement sets the stage for the entire case study and
informs the subsequent phases of data preparation, analysis, and
recommendations.

With a well-defined business task and an understanding of the key
stakeholders, we can proceed to the next phases of the case study to
gather, prepare, and analyze the data, ultimately leading to actionable
recommendations for Cyclistic's marketing strategy.

# PREPARE PHASE

## Data Sources

To begin preparing the data, I accessed the Cyclistic trip data from a
dedicated website repository that provides access to historical trip
records. This repository is the source of our data.

<https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>

The Cyclistic trip data is thoughtfully organized into multiple CSV
files, one for each quarter of the year. These files are in table format
and contain detailed information about individual bike trips. Key
attributes include trip start and end times, station locations, user
types (annual members and casual riders), and other trip-related
details. This dataset will be instrumental in answering our business
question.

Historical data on bike trips taken by Cyclistic customers. It is
organized in tabular format with columns representing attributes such as
trip duration, start and end stations, bike types, user types (annual
member or casual rider), and timestamps.

We have taken the necessary steps to verify the credibility and
integrity of our data. We conducted assessments to address potential
bias, data quality issues, and data integrity concerns. This rigorous
evaluation ensures that the data is reliable for analysis.

## **Key Tasks**

The Cyclistic Historical Bike Trip Data has been accessed and stored in
a secure format suitable for analysis, ensuring data accessibility and
security. We reviewed the data's organization, including column names
and data types, to understand its structure, facilitating efficient
analysis. As part of data preparation, data sorting and filtering were
applied to focus exclusively on relevant portions needed for our
analysis, streamlining our efforts. Our assessment included checks for
potential issues that might impact the reliability of our analysis. We
have diligently addressed these concerns.

## **Deliverable**

A description of all data sources used has been provided, focusing on
the primary data source, Cyclistic Historical Bike Trip Data. This
description sets the stage for data preparation and analysis in the
subsequent phases of the case study.

With a clear understanding of the data source and its organization, we
can proceed to the data cleaning and manipulation tasks in the "Process"
phase.

# PROCESS PHASE

During the "Process" phase, our primary goal was to ensure that the
Cyclistic trip data, which serves as the foundation of our analysis, was
well prepared and transformed to meet the highest standards of data
quality and readiness. This approach involved the installation of
essential R packages, the loading of libraries, and loading of
historical trip data for multiple months. Column names were checked for
consistency, and the structure of data frames was examined to understand
data types. Date and time data were transformed and standardized for
uniformity. The datasets were combined into a single unified dataset,
with columns renamed for improved clarity. Additionally, feature
engineering was applied to create new columns for day of the week,
month, time, and trip duration. Data cleaning steps were taken to remove
rows with negative trip durations, NULL values, and those related to
test rides. We also take a data quality check ensuring that the dataset
contained only two customer types. These preparation and cleaning
processes have yielded a clean, reliable dataset ready for in-depth
analysis, setting the stage for meaningful insights and informed
decision-making in the subsequent phases of the case study.

```

# ANALYZE & SHARE PHASE

In this phase, we leverage our carefully prepared dataset,
**`df_processed_v2`**, containing trip records from multiple months, to
gain meaningful insights into Cyclistic's bike trips. During the data
preparation phase, we standardized date and time formats and introduced
new columns for day of the week, month, time, and trip duration, setting
the stage for analysis. To extract insights, we'll perform various
calculations, including mean and maximum ride length, and determine the
mode of weekdays to identify popular riding days. We'll analyze data
patterns, discover trends, and draw conclusions, all of which will be
summarized in a deliverable. This summary will serve as the basis for
data-driven recommendations as we progress through the case study.

## Analysis Steps

Our analysis will entail segmenting the data into two groups: annual
members and casual riders. For both groups, we'll calculate descriptive
statistics, such as mean and median trip duration, trip frequency, and
usage patterns (weekdays vs. weekends). To effectively convey our
findings, we'll create informative visualizations like bar charts, line
graphs, and heat maps, facilitating comparisons between annual members
and casual riders and highlighting differences and trends. If needed,
hypothesis tests may be employed to assess the statistical significance
of observed distinctions. Ultimately, we will present key findings,
emphasizing disparities and commonalities in how these two user groups
utilize Cyclistic bikes. These insights will shape our marketing
strategy recommendations, providing actionable guidance for converting
casual riders into annual members.

```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(df_processed_v2$trip_duration)
```

```         
  Min.     1st Qu.   Median     Mean    3rd Qu.     Max.
  0.00     5.45      9.60      18.36    17.10    51461.40 
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
df_processed_v2 %>% 
  group_by(customer_type) %>% 
  summarise(min_trp_duration = min(trip_duration),max_trp_duration = max(trip_duration), median_trp_duration = median(trip_duration),
mean_trp_duration = mean(trip_duration))
```

![](images/summary%20of%20trip_duration%20by%20customer_type.png)

These summary statistics give you insights into how trip durations
differ between "casual" and "member" customers. We observed that both
"casual" and "member" customers can have very short trips, with a
minimum trip duration of 0 minutes. This indicates that some cyclist,
regardless of their type, use our services for quick trips. The "Casual"
customers can have significantly longer trips, with a maximum trip
duration reaching as high as 51461.400 minutes. In contrast, "member"
customers tend to have shorter trips, with a maximum duration of
1559.667 minutes. This suggests that "casual" customers are more likely
to use our services for extended journeys. The median trip duration for
"casual" customers is approximately 11.85 minutes, while for "member"
customers, it's approximately 8.51 minutes. On average, "casual"
customers have longer trips, with an average trip duration of
approximately 28.14 minutes, compared to "member" customers, who have an
average trip duration of approximately 12.38 minutes.

Order day_of_week column for easier reference

```{r eval=FALSE}
df_processed_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(df_processed_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun"))
```

Order month column

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create a vector of ordered months in the desired order 
ordered_months <- c("Aug_22", "Sep_22", "Oct_22", "Nov_22","Dec_22","Jan_23", "Feb_23", "Mar_23","Apr_23", "May_23","Jun_23","Jul_23")  
# Apply the ordered levels to the month column 
df_processed_v2$month <- ordered(df_processed_v2$month, levels = ordered_months)
```

Summarize into Table

```{r eval=FALSE}
df_processed_v2 %>% group_by(customer_type, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration_min = mean(trip_duration)) %>% 
  arrange(customer_type, desc(number_of_rides))
```

  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = customer_type)) +    
  labs(title = "Total trips by customer type Vs. Day of the week", 
       fill = "Customer Type") +

```

![](images/Rplot_Average%20trip%20dur.%20by%20customer%20type%20vs.%20day%20of%20the%20week.png)

***Observation** - Members use the bike-share service more than casual
riders on weekdays, especially from Monday to Friday. However, casual
riders use the service more on weekends, with the highest usage on
Saturdays and the lowest usage on Sundays. This means that members are
the main users of the bike-share service on weekdays, while casual
riders are the main users on weekends*

```

![](images/Rplot_Totral%20trips%20by%20customer%20type%20vs,%20month-02.png)

***Observation** - The graph shows a clear upward trend in usage over
time, proving an increase in the service's popularity as a go-to form of
transportation for both members and non-members. The consistent increase
indicates that numerous individuals are embracing this mode of
transportation. It is also obvious that the number of members who ride
constantly exceeds the number of casual riders. This variation might be
caused by users using the service frequently, depending on it for
commuting, or preferring it during peak times. The data also shows which
months of the year experience the highest and lowest levels of
ridership. Due to the better weather and more outside activities, June
and May are the busiest months for both members and casual riders.
However, there are fewer riders in December and January, maybe as a
result of the colder climate and altered travel patterns during the
holidays*.

**Visualisation 3**

```{r eval=FALSE}
df_processed_v2 %>% 
  group_by(customer_type, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(average_trip_duration = mean(trip_duration)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_trip_duration, fill = customer_type)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) + 
  labs(title = "Average trip duration by customer type Vs. Day of the week", 
       fill = "Customer Type",
       x = "Trip Duration",
       y = "Day of Week")+ 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("skyblue", "yellow"))
```

***Observation** - Casual riders have a longer average route duration
than members, but this does not necessarily mean that they cover twice
as much distance. This is because casual riders are more likely to take
shorter trips, such as commuting to and from work or school. The graph
shows a clear upward trend in the average travel duration for both
members and non-members from Monday to Sunday. This could be due to a
number of factors, including the likelihood that people have more free
time on weekends and are more likely to use the service for longer trips
like sightseeing tours or travels to discover new places. Casual riders
have longer trips than members because they are more likely to take
short trips, such as commuting to and from work or school.*

```

![](images/Rplot_Average%20trip%20dur.%20by%20customer%20type%20vs.%20month)

***Observation** - Member riders have a shorter average trip duration
than casual members throughout the year. The average trip duration of
casual members varies more than the average trip duration of member
riders. There does not seem to be a clear correlation between the month
and trip duration for either member or casual riders. This suggest that
there is a difference in the trip duration patterns of member and casual
riders. Member riders are more likely to take shorter trips throughout
the year, while casual members are more likely to take longer trips,
especially during the summer months. The variation in the average trip
duration of casual members is likely due to a number of factors, such as
the time of day, the day of the week, and the purpose of the trip.*

![](images/Demand%20over%2024%20hours%20of%20a%20day.png)

***Observation** - Highest demand occurs during morning (7am - 9am) and
evening (5pm - 7pm) rush hours. Likely due to commuting, work/school,
errands, and socializing. Lowest demand is during early morning (1am -
5am) and late night (11pm - 1am) hours. Casual customers have higher
demand during rush hours. Member customers have higher demand during
off-peak hours (10am - 4pm, 8pm - 10pm). While Member customers have
more flexibility and prefer non-peak hours to avoid crowds. This
illustrates a consistent demand pattern driven by factors like
commuting, work schedules, and social activities.*

Open Tableau.

Count unique **start_lat** and **start_lng** for casual riders targeted
in marketing efforts.

1.  **Connect to Data:** Start by connecting Tableau to
    DF_PROCESS_V2.csv dataset.

2.  **Filter for Casual Riders:** Create a filter to exclude rows where
    **`customer_type`** is like "casual."

3.  **Aggregation:** To count the occurrences of unique combinations of
    **`start_lat`** and **`start_lng`**, we need to create a calculated
    field that combines these two dimensions. In Tableau, you can create
    a calculated field as follows:

    -   Go to Analysis menu -\> Create Calculated Field.

    -   Name the calculated field **`LatLongCount`**

    -   Enter the following formula to concatenate **`start_lat`** and
        **`start_lng`**:

`{STR([start_lat]) + ", " + STR([start_lng])}`

***Observation** - The most popular start locations for casual riders in
Chicago are densely populated areas with a lot to offer, such as the
Loop, Near North Side, West Loop, Wicker Park, and Logan Square. Casual
riders are also using Divvy bikes to travel to and from airports and
between different stations.*

Count unique **end_lat** and **end_lng** for casual riders targeted in
marketing efforts.

***Observetion** - The most densely populated areas of the city have the
highest number of start locations, with the Loop and Near North Side
being the most popular. This suggests that casual riders are using Divvy
bikes to get around these busy areas. There are also a number of start
locations outside of the city center, such as at O'Hare and Midway
airports, and in the suburbs of Rosemont, Schaumburg, and Naperville.
This suggests that member are using Divvy bikes to travel to and from
these destinations, as well as to commute between different stations.*

1.  Understanding User Behavior:

Tailor the user experience on the Cyclistic app or website to cater to
the distinct preferences of annual members and casual riders. This might
involve personalized recommendations, exclusive offers, or ride
suggestions based on historical usage patterns. Also communicate the
advantages of annual memberships compared to pay-as-you-go options, such
as cost savings, convenience, and priority access to bikes. Utilize
intuitive infographics and testimonials to convey these benefits
effectively.

2\. Encouraging Casual Riders to Go Annual:

Introduce a limited-time trial annual membership at a discounted rate
for casual riders. This allows them to experience the convenience and
savings of an annual membership before committing fully. Develop a
loyalty program that rewards frequent casual riders with exclusive perks
and discounts, creating an incentive to transition to annual membership.
Highlight the long-term value and cost-efficiency of annual membership
compared to single rides.

3\. Leveraging Digital Media:

Utilize data-driven insights to craft highly targeted digital marketing
campaigns. Focus on demographics, locations, and interests of casual
riders who exhibit characteristics indicative of potential annual
members. Create engaging and informative content, such as blog posts,
videos, and social media campaigns, that highlights the benefits of
becoming an annual member. Showcase real-life success stories of riders
who made the switch. Collaborate with local influencers or cycling
enthusiasts to endorse Cyclistic's annual memberships. Their authentic
recommendations can resonate with casual riders and motivate them to
join.
